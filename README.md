# physics-sandbox-server
***[This project is still a work in progress]***

This project is a **backend-first browser-based 2D physics sandbox** with an authoritative Python server. The backend runs a real-time physics simulation using **Pymunk**, while the browser client renders the simulation using **HTML Canvas** and communicates with the server over **WebSockets**.

The focus of the project is software engineering rather than game design. It demonstrates **real-time systems, API design, server-authoritative state management, and clean backend architecture**. The frontend is intentionally minimal and exists only to visualize server state and send user input.

**Skills and Tools:**
- Python: FastAPI backend, real-time WebSocket communication
- Physics: Pymunk (2D rigid body simulation, constraints, forces)
- APIs & Networking: WebSockets for state sync, REST endpoints (planned)
- Frontend: HTML Canvas + vanilla JavaScript rendering
- Software Engineering: system design, deterministic simulation concepts, incremental development, Git-based workflow
